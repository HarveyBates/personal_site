## Introduction

Is innovation slowing? Although is a lack of concrete metrics that directly measure innovation, I believe there has been a lack of development in certain areas of scientific research. Take for example this study (https://web.stanford.edu/~chadj/IdeaPF.pdf) from researchers at Stanford University, which argue that the number of researchers is increasing while the productivity of these researchers is declining (Figure 1).

Figure 1. Research productivity (blue line) vs number of researchers (green line). Values are in comparison to the equivilent number of researchers and effective productivty in the 1930's.

From Figure 1 we can see that there are almost 32 times the amount of researchers in the 2000's compared to the 1930's; however, at the same time the effective productivity of these researchers is less than 1% of the 1930's. How could this be? If we look at worldwide education rates (in terms of literacy over time) we can see that the globally the world should have access to the best minds, the most innovative thinkers, as more people have access to better education (Figure 2).

The Stanford article states that research productivity halves every 13 years and suggests that the cause of this is that ideas may be getting harder and harder to find. This may be the case, but I believe the issue is within the *standardisation of problem solving taught to students at school and university*. 

## The standardisation of problem solving 

At school subjects are divided into their unique disciplines, biology, mathematics, physics, computer science, chemistry etc. This is used for many reasons, one of which is to create niches that students can specialise in to *fully* understand that topic. As students specialise further in university their thought process becomes increasingly homogenised within their specific discipline. As such biologists are taught to think like biologists and physicists solve problems like physicists etc. 

This becomes an issue as truely innovative solutions require a multi-disciplinary approach. In this way, having an extensive understanding of a specific topic while lacking an understanding of other areas of science results in a reduced ability to problem solve.

**For example:**
*A biologist studying fish wants to count the number of endangered species caught in a fishing vessels nets. They may propose an experiment where they count and identify each fish manually as they are processed onboard the ship. They are happy with this experiment as it is the best they can do with their available skills. Now if you give this same task to a computer scientist they will propose a machine vision model based on photos of lots of different types of fish (including the endangered ones), a camera facing the conveyor-belt on the ship automatically identifies the fish as they are processed and a computer captures all the data. As the computer scientist has automated the task the same method is applied to several ships simultaneously along with GPS data. From this the computer scientist can map the distribution of certain fish species and make suggestions to reduce fishing in areas where the endangered species is most abundant.*

Before I continue I will address the thoughts that a lot of you will be thinking, which is that specialisation is fine as long as there is cross-disciplinary collaboration. However, in my experience the politics of science rarely allows for this to happen. Take for example two laboratories, one studying biology and the other engineering, these two labs are managed independently with two directors. For a successful collaboration to take place the directors need to come to an agreement on who is responsible for which aspect. Most notably the last author on any resulting research is usually the group leader, if there are two group leaders then there can be conflict. 

In the above example the biologist has to understand that there are alternative avenues for conducting this kind of research. If the biologist stays within their discipline, they will never know that machine vision is even a possible solution. 

The most recent and widely popular example of a multidisciplinary approach to solving problems is AlphaFold (https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology). As a short introduction; AlphaFold is a deep learning model that is trained to fold proteins based on their amino acid composition. For decades researchers have understood make up of proteins but understanding how they fold is a much harder task. AlphaFold aims to speed up the rate at which the 3D structure of proteins can be resolved. To test AlphaFolds ability to accurately resolve the 3D structure of proteins it was baselined against conventional methods in a blind assessment known as CASP.

From Figure 3, we can see that providing a unique approach (using deep learning to resolve the 3D structure of proteins) there has been a significant increase in the accuracy of the resolved three-dimensional protein structure. This illustrates my point as the required solutions to problems may not arise from *closely* related disciplines. AlphaFold is one of a potentially endless amount of problems that could be solved if a multidisciplinary approach is adopted. I think that this is especially important in biology, where it seems that nature is so complex that members from outside biology are needed to start to understand complex biological problems.
