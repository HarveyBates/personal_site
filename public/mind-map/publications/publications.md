#### Abstract
In order to expand microalgae's use as a mainstream biotechnological resource, the efficiency of light capturing in culture vessels must be optimised. As a response to the complex nature of microalgal culture vessel modelling, it is important that a robust method to assess irradiance in photobioreactors (PBR's) is developed. Several hardware based or mathematical models to predict irradiance exist; however, these methods can be impractical as they are time-consuming, depend on growth vessel geometry or species to be cultivated. In this work, a chlorophyll a fluorescence imaging method was developed to assess both light penetration and utilisation in PBR's. This new method, termed normalized chlorophyll fluorescence imaging (NCFI), allows users to obtain images (light maps) that reflect irradiance as a function of depth into the PBR. This information is then combined with biophysical measurements to provide both 2D maps and 3D models of wavelength dependent light utilisation in PBR's. The methods presented in this work aim to demonstrate how these kinds of measurements are undertaken, the potential artefacts one may encounter and its utility for designing efficient PBR's that are optimised for maximal photosynthetic productivity.

### The Phenobottle, an open-source photobioreactor platform for environmental simulation

#### Abstract
Microalgal biotechnologies have great potential for biofuels, bioremediation, food technologies and more recently the production of pharmaceuticals. However, a major obstacle to use microalgae industrially is the optimisation of environmental parameters to the microalgal species of interest (light, CO2 availability, nutrients, etc.). If one aims to optimise productivity, the use of photobioreactors (PBRs) is essential. However, the restrictive design of the few commercial bioreactors and their elevated costs (> $10,000 USD ea.) prevents their use as a mainstream tool. To propel microalgal research we present the Phenobottle, a fully customizable open-source PBR platform (consisting of hardware and software). As the optimisation of photosynthesis is a central process to increasing the productivity of microalgae, the Phenobottle is equipped with a chlorophyll a fluorometer and growth sensors to probe metabolic performance in near-real time. An introductory guide is provided and the Phenobottle's sensors are benchmarked against commercial instruments using the model green alga Chlorella vulgaris.

### A guide to Open-JIP, a low-cost open-source chlorophyll fluorometer

#### Abstract
Chlorophyll a fluorescence is the most widely used method to study photosynthesis and plant stress. While several commercial fluorometers are available, there is a need for a low-cost and highly customisable chlorophyll fluorometer. Such a device would aid in performing high-throughput assessment of photosynthesis, as these instruments can be mass-produced. Novel investigations into photosynthesis can also be performed as a result of the userâ€™s ability to modify the devices functionality for their specific needs. Motivated by this, we present an open-source chlorophyll fluorometer based on the Kautsky induction curve (OJIP). The instrument consists of low-cost, easy-to-acquire electrical components and an open-source microcontroller (Arduino Mega) whose performance is equivalent to that of commercial instruments. Two 3D printable Open-JIP configurations are presented, one for higher plants and the other for microalgae cells in suspension. Directions for its construction are presented and the instrument is benchmarked against widely used commercial chlorophyll fluorometers.
